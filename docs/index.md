MarkLogic Geo Data Services (GDS) is a set of modules that can be added to your MarkLogic application to enable a rich
set of geospatial query capabilities against a MarkLogic database. Generally, you will add GDS to your MarkLogic
application because you are either using the
[MarkLogic Koop Provider](https://github.com/koopjs/koop-provider-marklogic) or the
[MarkLogic GeoTools Plugin](https://github.com/marklogic-community/marklogic-geotools-plugin). This user guide focuses 
on installing and configuring GDS so that it can be accessed via either of those tools. You may also use GDS by itself,
though this guide does not yet describe the MarkLogic REST extensions that comprise GDS and how they can be used.

To start using GDS, read through the following guides in the given order:

1. [Install GDS](install.md)
2. [Create a MarkLogic user](create-user.md)
3. [Create a TDE template](create-tde.md)
4. [Create a service descriptor](create-service-descriptor.md)

The [tutorial](tutorial.md) provides a walk through of creating a new project that uses GDS.
