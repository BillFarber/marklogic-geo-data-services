# MarkLogic Geo Data Services

MarkLogic Geo Data Services (GDS) is a set of modules that can be added to your MarkLogic application to enable a rich
set of geospatial query capabilities against a MarkLogic database. Generally, you will add GDS to your MarkLogic 
application because you are either using the 
[MarkLogic Koop Provider](https://github.com/koopjs/koop-provider-marklogic) or the 
[MarkLogic GeoTools Plugin](https://github.com/marklogic-community/marklogic-geotools-plugin). 

Please see [the user guide](https://marklogic.github.io/marklogic-geo-data-services/) for 
instructions on installing and using GDS.
